# 🩺 CNN for Histopathologic Cancer Detection (Kaggle Practice)

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **MobileNetV2** as the base model and hyperparameter tuning via **KerasTuner** to classify histopathologic images as **benign** or **metastatic cancer**.

Although this dataset was part of the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data), the competition has since closed — this work was done **purely for practice and to expand my deep learning expertise**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data)  
- **Images:** 96x96-pixel patches from lymph node sections.
- **Labels:**  
  - `0`: Benign tissue  
  - `1`: Metastatic cancer  

The dataset was downloaded using the Kaggle API, preprocessed, and split into **training (80%)** and **validation (20%)** sets with stratification to maintain label balance.

---

## 🏗 Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** MobileNetV2 (ImageNet pretrained, frozen during training)
- **Custom Layers:**
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D
  - Dense layer (tuned units)
  - Dropout layer (tuned rate)
  - Final Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') for binary classification
- **Optimiser & Hyperparameters:** Tuned using **KerasTuner RandomSearch**

---

## 🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning
Used **KerasTuner Random Search** to find optimal values for:
- Units in Dense layer
- Dropout rate
- Learning rate
- Optimiser choice (`adam` or `rmsprop`)

---

**Best Hyperparameters:**
- Units in Dense layer: **416**

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Fine-tune MobileNetV2 layers (unfreeze top layers for additional training)
- Experiment with other base models (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet50)
- Try different augmentation strategies for better generalisation
- Expand hyperparameter search space for deeper tuning
